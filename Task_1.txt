Document Object & Window Object

1.Document  Object:

- A document object represents the content of a web page, such as text, images and other media. It is created by the browser when it reads HTML file of the web page.
- The document object represents the entire web page that is being viewed in a browser. eg HTML,CSS,JS
- It contains all elements of an HTML page like head, body etc.
- Every web page has one and only one document object.


2.Window Object:

- A window object is associated with each tab or window in a browser.
- Each JavaScript program runs within the context of Window Object.
- It provides access to properties and methods related to the webpage and user interface.
- There can be multiple windows (tabs) open at once in a browser.


3.Relationship & Difference between Document and Window objects:

Relationship

- The document object is embedded within the window object, serving as a child entity within the broader context of the window.
- Document object represents the content of a web page while the Window object represents the actual browser window.
- In JavaScript, you can use "document" keyword to refer to the current document inside any function or method that is associated with the Document object.
- Window object controls browser-related functionalities like resizing, navigation, and event handling.
- Methods available in both Document and  Window objects are called Methods while those specific to either Document or Window objects are referred as Properties.


Difference

Document Object

- Document object does not have any knowledge about its environment; it cannot interact directly with the browser.
- Document object doesnâ€™t know anything about the browser it's running on.
- It only knows about its own data model i.e., DOM(Document Object Model).
- It interacts with other documents through links/frames.

Window Object

- Window object knows everything about itself and the browser it's running on.
- It provides information about screen size, scroll position, cookies, location, etc.
- It also provides functionality for these aspects like alert(), prompt() etc.
- We may need to use `window` keyword while accessing properties/methods of the Window object
